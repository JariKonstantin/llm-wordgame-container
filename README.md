# llm-wordgame-container

## Setup

1. Go into llm-wordgame folder and create .env from .env.example
2. run `docker compose build` and then `docker compose up` in root folder

- The first time build and up are run can take a while since the llm libraries and models need to download sizeable amounts of data
